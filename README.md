# devFind - Discover and Connect with Skilled Developers.

devFind is an open source project that aims to create a platform for developers to showcase their skills and connect with potential collaborators, all in a user-friendly and searchable format. With devFind, developers can create their profiles in JSON format, which are then displayed on the web for others to discover.

One of the key features of devFind is its powerful search functionality. Users can search for developers based on specific skills, making it easy to find developers with expertise in a particular technology or programming language. This makes devFind a valuable resource for project managers, recruiters, and anyone looking to connect with skilled developers for collaboration or employment opportunities.
