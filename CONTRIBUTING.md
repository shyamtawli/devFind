Thank you for your interest in contributing to devFind! Here is a guide to help you get started:

## **Set up your environment**

To contribute to devFind, you will need to have Node.js and Git installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Git can be downloaded from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have installed these dependencies, you can clone the devFind repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/shyamtawli/devFind.git

## **Install `pnpm`**

To install `pnpm` use this command.

    npm install -g pnpm

## **Install dependencies**

Navigate to the project folder on your terminal and install the dependencies using:

    cd devFind
    pnpm install

## **Run the application**

Run the following command to start the application:

    pnpm start

## **Create a new branch**

Before you start making changes, create a new branch to work on. This helps keep your changes separate from the main codebase, making it easier to manage and review your contributions later.

You can create a new branch using the following command:

    git checkout -b your-branch-name

## **Make your changes**

Now that you have set up your environment and created a new branch, you can start making your changes. You can modify existing code, add new features or fix bugs.

## **Test your changes**

Before submitting your changes, it is important to test them thoroughly to make sure they work as expected. Run the following command to test the application:

    pnpm test

This will run all the tests in the project and give you feedback on any failures.

## **Commit your changes**

Once you have tested your changes, you can commit them to your local branch using the following command:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"

## **Push your changes**

After committing your changes, you can push them to your remote branch using the following command:

    git push origin your-branch-name

## **Create a pull request**

Now that your changes are pushed to your remote branch, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the main codebase. Navigate to the devFind repository on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. Follow the instructions to create your pull request.

## **Participate in code reviews**

Your pull request will be reviewed by other contributors to ensure it meets the project's standards and does not introduce any bugs or security vulnerabilities. Be prepared to make additional changes or address any feedback that is given.

## **Merge your changes**

Once your pull request is approved and passes all tests, it can be merged into the main codebase. Congratulations, you have successfully contributed to devFind!
